Put the ports dir (extracted from the tarball from the download link above or 
checked out of git) somewhere such as your home dir.

Then add the following line to /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf:
(make sure the file:/// line is above the rsync:// lines in that file so these
ports take precedence)

file:///Users/<name>/ports

Then run:

# (cd ~/ports/ && sudo portindex )

Install qt first with:

# sudo port -d install qt4-mac +ssl +sqlite

!!!!!! important
qt4 breaks with a parallel builds so make sure buildmakejobs is set to 1 in 
macports.conf for merging this port


NOTE
To enable parallel builds at this point, add the following to your /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf:
buildmakejobs           2


if you have trouble building boost, see the following link:
http://lists.macosforge.org/pipermail/macports-users/2008-May/010225.html


You might also need to run the fix-link.sh script that comes with this tarball.


I've also had luck running kbuildsycoca4 before starting apps.
